        "- Visualization plays a crucial role in polynomial regression for several reasons:\n",
        "- Understanding Relationships: Visualization helps you understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. By plotting the data points and the fitted polynomial curve, you can see how well the model captures the underlying pattern.\n",
        "- Identifying Patterns: It allows you to identify non-linear patterns in the data that might not be apparent from numerical summaries. You can see the bends, peaks, and troughs in the polynomial curve.\n",
        "- Model Evaluation: Visualization helps evaluate the model's fit. Residual plots can show how well the model captures the data and whether the residuals are randomly scattered or show patterns, indicating potential issues like heteroscedasticity."
